# ChatWithYourPDF_Bot

**ChatWithYourPDF_Bot** is a conversational AI chatbot that interacts with users based on the content of PDF documents. Built using `langchain` and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo, this application processes PDF files and responds to user queries about the content.

## Features

## How It Works

1. **Upload PDF**: Users upload a PDF through the app interface.
